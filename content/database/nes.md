Power bricks:

* North America (top and front loading both)
    * Product Code(s): NES-002
    * Voltage: 9V
    * Amps: 1.3A
    * Polarity: The NES has a rectifier and will accept either polarity.
    * Tip Size: 2.1mm x 5.5mm
    * It's been said that it'll accept any ~1.0A 9V adapter and polarity doesn't matter. Note this is *NORTH AMERICA ONLY*, **polarity matters on Japanese/Asian units!**

* Japan
    * Product Code(s): HVC-002
    * Voltage: 10V
    * Amps: 850mA
    * Polarity: Negative
    * Tip Size: 
    * It's suggested you either get a step-down converter or don't use the original brick in the USA (110V vs 100V) as it may overheat and damage the brick and/or console. As long as the output matches what the system wants, any power supply should be sufficient.
