Upgrade went cleanly, as did the migration to WSL2. Even managed to get systemd working, though I feel like it might be better to wait until the official full release of WSL2; I fully expect that the supported distros will add systemd support shortly after WSL2 is in the generally available category.

Won't know about any issues with the Windows 10 side of things until I've had more time to test things.
