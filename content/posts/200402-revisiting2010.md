When I took a leave of absence from Sanctuary Crew for an extended period, it created a bit of a hole in the team. To my regret I've ever been the one deep-end technical monkey, and the main SC website fell into a pretty bad state with me gone and Floofy dealing with her own life situation.

While I'm still officially retired, it's been my intention to make good on some of the maintenance tasks that only I can do. I'd taken a few steps towards that yesterday by taking an old 2010 version of the Sanctuary Crew website that Floofy designed for her capstone project back then, and beginning the long task of converting it to a slightly more modern template engine.

I've got a long way to go before it's even remotely where I want it to be. I don't expect this to derail any of my other tasks as there's no deadline on getting this done. I'll work on it as inspiration hits and not push myself too hard when it's not there.

I still need to keep up with physical therapy, too. I guess finding a good balance just requires time and effort.
