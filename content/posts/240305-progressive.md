It looks like I'm going to have a lot more time to write on this blog
from this point onward; my condition has drastically worsened in the
last month and I can only use my hands for short bursts. I knew this was
going to eventually happen-- my condition is progressive and will thus
get worse over time as my spinal damage develops arthritis.

I don't want to sound dismissive but "it is what it is"-- I'm not
exactly in a depressive state over it, but I am somewhat angry at myself
for my inability to keep my emotional outbursts under control. This
seems to be getting worse as my condition worsens and I suspect it's
related to my overall nervous system issues on top of being genetic.
This issue runs in my father's side of the family, unfortunately, along
with both very bad reactions to stress and heart conditions.

Thus, without the time and energy to maintain them, I've shut down my
social media accounts. I'm vaguely tempted to re-open them if just to
spite a certain other guy who covets the name and apparently insists
that I am "not the real Firehawke"...

I've started to use speech recognition more and more. I find it
particularly odd that an iPad has significantly better accuracy in
speech recognition than Windows 11, despite having a better microphone
on the computer and more processing power behind it.

Thankfully I can use Splashtop to connect to my PC to use the iPad's
dictation mode to do longer-form typing by voice.

I'm planning on looking into how much of Visual Studio Code I can get
to be voice-controlled. I've put in a couple of very minor MAME updates
this month, but until I get the feel for where I actually am
health-wise (and what tools are available) I'm probably going to be
sporadic at best on that.

I also just started saving myself $150/year on hosting fees by migrating
the site over to github.io; I was already using GitHub to host the git
repository that the posts are in, so adjusting the process slightly to
also make the output directory a git repository was a one-minute
adjustment at most.

I'll be writing another post in the near-future (probably tomorrow, 
even) about the Yuzu/Citra situation and my reading on how all of 
that is playing out. I have definite opinions on that!
