I'm trying something a bit experimental here. A post on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22671721) led me to a blog post over at [Ryan Prior's site](https://www.ryanprior.com/posts/svelte-is-unappealing/). The post itself was interesting, but not really what grabbed me. What interested me most was the static site itself. That sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole for about two hours into the world of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

That, in turn, resulted in what you see here. I rather like the idea of a semi-static site as opposed to Wordpress-- it requires considerably less maintenance time. The problem with Wordpress isn't Wordpress itself, it's the plugins; those plugins are literally 99% of the exploit vectors on WP blogs and requires significant effort to stay ahead of attackers.

A static site doesn't require nearly as much effort.

As such, I'll give this a try and see if I can't build an acceptable workflow around this. I'm probably going to use this for personal thoughts and continue using my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/firehawke) to handle news about what I'm doing with MAME-related projects.
