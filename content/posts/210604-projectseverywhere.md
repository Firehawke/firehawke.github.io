Current work in MAME is directly related to a new effort to obtain and dump Apple IIgs disks. The GS model wasn't terribly successful as a whole, but it was a very interesting piece of hardware-- a 16-bit descendent of the Apple II line that retained a considerable level of compatibility with those older disks while having significantly improved graphics and sound capabilities. By 1992, though, it was definitely showing limitations against the growing popularity of the "IBM-Compatible" market and the relatively cheap upgrade options for graphics and sound.

My work with the IIgs software lists has required me to spend some time on refactoring my tools to work better with IIgs-specific disks. A lot has been done on that, but I'm not going to say it's "done" until I can go a month without needing to further refine my script.

I'm at least keeping up on the Apple efforts. If I fell behind by any real amount, it'd be difficult to catch up.

On the medical side of my life, things have certainly gotten a lot more complicated this year. I've learned that the source of my current struggles to be effective at much of anything on a day to day basis are predicated on a cocktail of neuropathy (now on both sides of my body) and pinched nerves at two very specific locations that affect my whole body. It's more than a little frustrating to struggle to get enough energy to do the projects I've committed myself to, but I'm not willing to give up.

Part of me currently wonders if this is the harbinger of the final descent into being 100% incapable. I imagine that's the worry that just about anyone dealing with a physical disability shares, so I'm going to do my best to not dwell on this. It probably won't be a successful attempt, but I need to keep trying.

I'm also in the middle of yet another medical provider changeover. My previous primary care physician just ended her association with the office I was going to for pain management. As a result of her going to a completely new office, I need to find a new primary care that accepts my insurance. The timing on this couldn't be worse-- I need to have that new primary care for my neurologist to send the finished report (from my EMG tests) to, and then that primary care needs to pass that on to physical therapy.

In other words, if I don't get everything lined up just right, there will be a huge delay on the physical therapy that may prevent some of the pinched nerve damage from becoming a permanent form of damage. If you prefer, it could also be described as "delays could cause irreparable harm."

I found a blog entry from late last year that was stopped right at the point where I'd been waylaid by the need to look into possible ear surgery. Rather than put it up as it was, I'll cover the points I think are still important here.

It's hard to be sure how much of my condition is cyclic, but there's definitely a pattern to September/October being when my health gets notably worse. I probably won't be able to get any real evidence on that subject until the current problems are stabilized enough to see through the smoke and mirrors. So, probably another two years of wondering.

That said, this has also taught me that I need to be especially cautious about taking on large projects around the fall/winter months. I have no practical way of judging when or how hard the yearly impact against my nervous system will be. I spent most of late November and December mentally cursing myself out for committing to something that I was clearly not capable of actually getting done right then in regards to the documentation overhaul.

It doesn't help that this coincides with some difficulty getting my medications. Being behind on blood pressure medication AND on the critical Vitamin B12 injections drains my energy level much faster and you can imagine how that intersects with the existing workload and ability to keep on top of things.

If I can get my current situation stabilized, I can hopefully get back to that before the end of this month. That's only if I can get things stabilized, meaning having a new primary care doctor (or finding out that the old doctor's new team accepts my insurance) and getting the physical therapy running again.
