It's been my intent to try to get a fresh start on my projects as of August. I can't really make any promises that I'll be able to keep to it with all of my health issues, but rebuilding this blog in a new location (with redirects for the older content!) is a good start towards my goals.

Can't type for long right now, as getting this set up took a lot out of my hands already. I'll see about putting more up later as time, energy, and arm condition allows.
