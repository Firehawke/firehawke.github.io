While I have my desktop machine up and running, I've been wanting to use the laptop a bit more for my workflow. There's just one little thing that was bothering me: occasional complete system hesitation. The whole machine would just completely *stop*. No mouse movements, no keyboard response, *nothing*-- for about ten seconds, then it'd suddenly come back to life and all the backed up input would just be there.

I've been suspecting it was the hard drive. I mean, it's a 2.5" laptop mechanical drive dating to 2011-- it certainly wasn't expected to last this long in general. I swapped in an extra SSD I can't use in my main machine (for incredibly annoying reasons) and reinstalled Linux. The reinstall wasn't strictly necessary, but it's nice to get a clean install and see about doing a better job of customizing it from the very start this time.

That takes a bit of time, though. I've got it about 3/4 of where I want it to be after about five hours, so I can't really complain. Since I'm not using an encrypted volume this time (those really do not get along with SSDs) I can do a proper disk image backup as well.

It isn't showing any of the hesitation it did before, so it probably *was* the drive. I'll know for sure in the next day or two.
