I've been meaning to do this since around February of this year, but finally got to it in November. I've added a new [Database](https://firehawke.sanctuarycrew.com/database) section to the site.

The database area will be for keeping track of often-difficult-to-obtain information. I've started by adding power adaptor specifications for two types of gaming consoles and for the Applesauce device. There will be more added as I come across information that I consider difficult enough to find to want to add to the database.
