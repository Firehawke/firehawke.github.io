It's working pretty much the way I'd hoped. I'll still be fiddling with the settings for a few days at minimum, of course. The nice thing is that I can *git push* to update this. I'm not sure if I want to add a comments system or not, though. I'll give it some thought.

Expect another post in the next 24 hours where I actually start to talk about what's on my mind right now.
