The COVID-19 thing I talked about in my last post ended up, thankfully, being a non-issue (other than added stress) as there were no symptoms in anyone here. That, at least, was a relief.

October, on the other hand, ended up being a pretty large set of disasters. I had both computers down for different reasons-- one lost the OS, the other (the Surface Pro 4) had a hardware failure that can't be fixed as it's no longer seeing the onboard camera or SSD. I also had a microwave fire hazard, one monitor and a second SSD die, and a level three hypertension event due to stress and an inability to get my blood pressure medication. Also, more ISP-related problems including a neighborhood-wide underground cable issue that can't be fixed until they have permission to dig under the road. As you might expect, the city isn't moving very fast on that.

I did eventually get the blood pressure medication, about three weeks after I should have had it.

On top of that, my neurological issues crept back in, which pretty much confirms the theory that I had that they get worse around winter and ease up around the time the temperatures start to go back up.

Yeah, I have pretty rotten luck in general. I'm mostly shrugging at it right now; you get used to things coming in massive waves after awhile.

I haven't been sleeping as well as I should, but I'm not giving up. I'll find a way to make this all work one way or another.

On the MAME side of things, I'm continuing to work on the Apple disks-- those are being kept up to date 99% of the time, with the exception of disks dumped around the point of code freeze; those will show up in the next month. Documentation projects have been on hold for a bit but I intend to talk to people I need to be talking with in order to get things back on track very soon-- most likely this coming weekend.

For the moment, I think I'm going to try to take the rest of the week a bit easy. I have three doctor appointments across Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday and that's going to include a lot of travel time. Context switching gets very difficult when you have so much going on and your physical condition isn't the best, so I'll just wait things out a bit and jump back onto the bandwagon with both feet when things settle enough.
