As per Sanctuary Crew tradition: Don't be an ass. It's really that simple. I don't have the time to babysit and while I'll accept light trolling, I'll come down hard on people who are just being dicks for the sake of being dicks.

Anything you could possibly do that would get you in trouble with me can be boiled down to "you're being a dick," so I don't feel the need to be extremely specific on rules.

I don't expect most people will run afoul of this; in the number of years I've helped run Discord/Mumble/etc servers, I think there's been maybe three people given the boot at most.

If you really feel you have a problem with this policy or you're worried you're not handling it well, reach out to me and we can talk.
