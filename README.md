# Firehawke's Braindump
This is the Git repository that generates the [Firehawke.net](https://www.firehawke.net) site via GitHub Actions. This is saving me $150/year on
DreamHost hosting charges for a very simple personal tech blog.

The theme being used is [Hello Friend NG](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng).
